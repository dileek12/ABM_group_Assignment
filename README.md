# An Agent-Based Approach for Sri Lanka’s Renewable Energy Transition

This project is an **Agent-Based Model (ABM)** built in **NetLogo** to simulate Sri Lanka’s electrical power grid system with enhanced renewable energy integration and advanced battery energy storage management.  

It provides insights into the dynamics of renewable adoption, grid stability, and economic policies under different scenarios.

## 🚀 What is it?

The model simulates the complex interactions between:

- Renewable sources (Solar, Wind, Hydro, Biomass)  
- Thermal power plants (Coal, Diesel)  
- Battery energy storage systems  
- Distributors (CEB, LECO)  
- Consumers (Residential, Industrial, Commercial)  

It incorporates real-world factors including weather variability, daily/seasonal demand patterns, regional grid distribution, and market-based pricing.

## ⚡ How it Works

### Agent Types
- **Suppliers (Power Plants)**: Solar, Wind, Hydro, Thermal, Biomass, and Battery storage  
- **Distributors**: Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and Lanka Electricity Company (LECO)  
- **Consumers**: Residential, Industrial, and Commercial users  

### Key Features
- Advanced battery management (charging, discharging, degradation tracking)  
- Dynamic weather simulation (solar irradiance, rainfall, wind speed, cloud cover)  
- Time-based operations (daily & seasonal cycles, peak demand hours)  
- Regional distribution with grid stability and blackout risk monitoring  
- Economic modeling (fuel price, carbon tax, subsidies, supply-demand price dynamics)

## 🛠 How to Use

1. **Setup**: Click **Setup** in NetLogo to initialize the model with all agents.  
2. **Run**: Click **Go** to start simulation (hourly & daily progression).  
3. **Monitor**: Track real-time metrics such as power generation, consumption, renewable share, battery status, and grid stability.

### Controls
- **Weather parameters**: solar irradiance, wind speed, rainfall, volatility  
- **Market parameters**: fuel price index, carbon tax, renewable subsidy  
- **System controls**: simulation speed, pause, consumer satisfaction toggle  
- **Scenario buttons**: simulate sunny/windy/rainy/cloudy weather, plant failure, transmission failure, demand changes, and emergency battery discharge
